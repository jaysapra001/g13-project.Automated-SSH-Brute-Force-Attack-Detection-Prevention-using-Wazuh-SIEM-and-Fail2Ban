Project Profile
This project focuses on securing Linux-based servers against SSH brute-force attacks, which 
remain one of the most common methods attackers use to gain unauthorized access. The
solution integrates Wazuh, an open-source SIEM platform, with Fail2Ban, a log-based
intrusion prevention tool, to provide both real-time detection and automated prevention.
Wazuh continuously monitors authentication logs, applies custom rules to detect suspicious
activity, and raises alerts when brute-force patterns are observed. In parallel, Fail2Ban
dynamically blocks malicious IP addresses by modifying firewall rules, thereby preventing
further intrusion attempts. This combined approach offers a robust, automated defense system
with minimal manual intervention.
The outcome of this project is a fully functional, open-source intrusion detection and
prevention system tailored for SSH security. It will provide real-time monitoring, automated
blocking of attackers, and comprehensive reporting, making it a cost-effective security
solution for small to medium enterprises.
